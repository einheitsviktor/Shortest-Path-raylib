# Shortest-Path-raylib

This is an improvement to my [Shortest-path GUI](https://github.com/einheitsviktor/Shortest-Path) implemented in Qt.
This time I use [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) ("... a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming.") to make the interactions more convenient.
<!-- This is my attempt to implement a GUI in C++ to find the shortest path in a two-dimensional field. -->

Regarding the logic I followed this [guide](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html) very closely.
